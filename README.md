# Cosmic density calculator

Enter the mass and volume of a object; this calculator tells you the density of your object, and how it compares to the density of the planets in our solar system.

As a class, were initially tasked with making a BMI (body mass index) calculator. However, I object to the concept of BMI on an ethical and scientific level, so I came up with an alternative assignment to practice the same skills:
- JS and DOM
- Letting the user enter two number values
- Using a function to perform a calculation based on those two values
- Categorizing the result according to value ranges
- Giving the user a sentence containing the result and its categorization, and showing an image to illustrate this feedback

Some of my classmates chose to follow my alternative assignment idea instead of the original.
